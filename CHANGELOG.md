- The base client is complete; it will allow you to establish a session,
  terminate a session, and issue requests to the DynECT REST API endpoints
- TODO
  - Structs for marshaling and unmarshaling requests and responses still need
	to be done, as the current set of provided struct is all that is needed
	to be able to log in and create a session
  - More structs will be added on an "as I need them" basis
