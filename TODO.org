* TODO Heartbeat
  Add a Heartbeat() method to the dynect.Client type, for cases where a client
  may be used in a situation where there are extended periods of no API calls.

  The Heartbeat() method would simply issue an HTTP PUT request to the 
  "/REST/Session" endpoint to keep the session alive.

  The Heartbeat() method could also, potentially, be complemented with
  StartHeartbeat() and StopHeartbeat() methods to have the heartbeating run in
  the background.

** TODO go-dynect/dynect.Client.Heartbeat()
   Send an HTTP PUT request to "/REST/Session".

** TODO go-dynect/dynect.Client.StartHeartbeat()
   Start a goroutine, in the background, that will periodically call the
   Heartbeat() method.

** TODO go-dynect/dynect.Client.StopHeartbeat()
   Stop the background goroutine that is periodically calling the Heartbeat()
   method.
