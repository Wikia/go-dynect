# go-dynect

Libraries and utilities for working with DynECT's API.

Each sub-package has their own README, and I recommend checking those out.

## go-dynect/dynect

The `github.com/nesv/go-dynect/dynect` package provides a simple HTTP/JSON
client and structs for working with DynECT's API. To use it, just run:

	$ go get github.com/nesv/go-dynect/dynect
	
## go-dynect/dynctl

The dynctl command is a work-in-progress utility that lets you manage your
DynECT records from the command-line. To install it, run:

	$ go get github.com/nesv/go-dynct/dynctl
